### About the Community-Archive Jekyll Theme

This Jekyll theme was designed for folks who want to host a simple online exhibit on Github Pages for free with minimal technical skill. There are no additional plugins or other complex dependencies; it will just run on Github Pages, and you can use Github's built-in web-based editor to add new files or update existing files.

### Who is it for?

This theme works best for communities who need simple archiving with minimal technical skills and simple workflows. To keep things simple, it doesn't have built-in search or filtering. ***If this sounds like you, and you don't need blogs or other add-ons yet, the best way to start is using the Quick Start guide, above.***

If you need something more complex but want to stick with Github Pages because it's free and doesn't require you to find a web host of your own, we recommend either [Minicomp/Wax](https://minicomp.github.io/wax/) (a Github theme with searching, filtering and IIIF metadata to formalize information about your collection) or [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io) (a Github theme that uses Google Spreadsheets to incorporate maps and timelines).

That said, anyone can use Community-Archive. If you're familiar with Github Pages and Jekyll, or you want blog posts and an item collection, this version of the theme is a kitchen-sink version with everything in it. You can fork it as you would any other Jekyll theme.

### How it started

The [IDAH@IU team](https://idah.indiana.edu) often gets requests to support archiving projects. This repository provides a starting point, a template for using simple Github Pages, done in partnership with [ImaginX en Movimiento (IXeM)](https://www.instagram.com/ixemcollective/?hl=en) co-founded by Marisa Hicks-Alcaraz, the [Center for Research on Race, Ethnicity and Society](https://crres.indiana.edu), and the [Asian Culture Center](https://asianresource.indiana.edu) at Indiana University Bloomington, and with thanks to Jazma Sutton and the [Remembering Freedom](https://longtownhistory.github.io) descendant community in Greenville and Longtown, Ohio, for the community-archive project that inspired this template.
