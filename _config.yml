# WHAT IS ALL THIS STUFF? SOME VOCABULARY.
#---------------------
# _config is easy. Most web sites have configuration files.
# .yml means YAML. It's the data that runs your site.
# Some files, like this one, are entirely made up of YAML.
# Lines with information that isn't YAML are commented out; the lines start with #
# Those lines will be ignored by the computer but provide important information to you.
#
##############################################
# WHAT DO I DO NOW?
#---------------------
# Look for the lines that have a bunch of ### in row.
# These break _config.yml into sections.
# You'll need to do something slightly different in each section.
# If you see an instruction to "comment out", add a # to the beginning of the line(s).
# If you see an instruction to "uncomment", remove the # at the beginning of the line(s).

##############################################
# THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER
#---------------------
# Variables are the things that drive your site.
# In YAML, there's a variable name--a placeholder--at the beginning of the line.
# Variables have colons after them in YAML.
# After the variable comes the actual contents of the variable, usually in double quotes
#               title: "Your Site Title"
# If you use another double quote inside your variable, it will break this config file.
#               title: "My "So-Called" Website"
